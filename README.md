# NLP World
- Repo of all my NLP projects and work

## What is Natural Language Processing
- NLP is the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech
- It helps machines process and understand the human language, so they can perform tasks or even reply with text or speech
- 



### Machine Translation

### Summarization

### Classification

### Spell Check

### Sentiment analysis - Classification
- Detect emotion


## How

- Text needs to be transformed to a something machines can process

### Pre Processing Tasks

- Tokenization - Break text into smaller semantic units or singles clauses.
- Part Of Speech Tagging - Marking up words as Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, Pronouns, etc.
- Stemming and Lemmatization - Standardizing words by reducing them to their root forms
- Stop word removal - filtering out common words that add little or no unique information - Prepositions and articles (at, to, a, the)

## Algorithms
- Rule based - Handcrafted grammatical rules
- Machine learning - Statistical methods that learn to perform tasks based on training data

## Examples

### Text Classification - Categorising text
- Sentiment Analysis - Analyzing emotions and classifying them
- Topics Classification - Identifying main themes or topics within a text
- Intent Detection - Identifying purpose, goal or intention behind text 

### Text Extraction - Extracting specific data
- Keyword Extraction - extract most important words and expressions. Provides a preview or summary.
- Named Entity recognition (NER) - extract names of people, companies, places etc

### Machine Translation
- Language translation

### Topic Modeling
- Grouping texts with similar words and expressions

### Natural Language Generation - NLG
- Analyzing unstructured data and using it as an input to automatically create content
